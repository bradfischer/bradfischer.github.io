    <img src="../images/nerd.jpg" alt="Me">

    <p> My name is Brad Fischer and I am 21 years old.
    I am currently enrolled at Towson University
    where I am getting a degree in Graphic Design
    with a minor in Marketing. I first went to CCBC
    and graduated with an Associates Degree in Art.
    I havenâ€™t always loved art, but ever since starting
    at CCBC, i have enjoyed creating it and seeing it.
    I enjoy playing video games and playing sports.
    My sports include soccer, lacrosse, and golf.
    The type of art I do is a lot of free art that is
    enjoyable for all ages. I am currently employed
    at Woodholme Country Club located in
    Pikesville Maryland.
