    <p>This website is very very cool and I wish I could do what it did in the beginning. Once clicking the link, this crazy design of active theory comes together and then these pixel cells come on the screen and when you move the mouse, it moves with you. Its very very cool and very animated. I believe this website covers a lot of spoets and video game things since the first 2 headers will things about Halo and Under Armor. I would love to learn how to make an animated sub home page for my viewers to be interested in before they actually look at my page.</p>
