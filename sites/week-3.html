    <p>This website is perfect for what we are currently doing with home pages and project links. This home page is set up with a lot of animation. The animation is the way to get all of his content. Opening the page designs this box/tape/cassette looking design where when you put your mouse on it, it has different tabs for you that you can click. The tabs include the home, play any music or movie he has offered, contents, projects, about, and connect. Learning how to do that would be very cool for an animated looking home page. It would also be very cool for audiences to have a little fun before looking at your stuff.</p>
