      <p> My name is Brad Fischer and I am 21 years old.
      I am currently enrolled at Towson University
      where I am getting a degree in Graphic Design
      with a minor in Marketing. I first went to CCBC
      and graduated with an Associates Degree in Art.
      I havenâ€™t always loved art, but ever since starting
      at CCBC, i have enjoyed creating it and seeing it.
      I enjoy playing video games and playing sports.
      My sports include soccer, lacrosse, and golf.
      The type of art I do is a lot of free art that is
      enjoyable for all ages. I am currently employed
      at Woodholme Country Club located in
      Pikesville Maryland.
