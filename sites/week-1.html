    <p>The website that I picked was the use of soundcloud.com. Sound cloud is a website that I have used for many years and it is probably the website I use the most. When I log on to my computer that automatically pops up. The layout of the website with all the music and the way the music is organized and portrayed with various helpful tabs is great. What interests me the most is how you actually get music to load to a website, and with the click of a button you can make it play.  I also enjoy the animations of certain peoples pages where once you hover over or click their name, they have a nice background or a pop up of some of there music. I would love for that to be apart of my portfolio website.</p>
