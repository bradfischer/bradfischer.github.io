    <p>The one thing I like about this website is that it is exactly how I wanted to do my homepage for my website. The way he did it of course is much better. The way I did it was I used all my pictures of my projects as a contact sheet in Adobe Bridge. I would love to find out how he did his and how he made it look so crisp and I would use that for my home page. The color scheme he chose is also a very good choice with the type of work he is used to doing.
