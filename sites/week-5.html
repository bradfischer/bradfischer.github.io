    <p>i would love to use this design as sort of a loading screen for my audience to have alittle fun and enjoy waiting to see the rest of the website. The website shows an animal that looks to be a bear, and it is made of all pixels and with the movement of the mouse, the bear moves and you can rotate it and make it run in different directions. very interesting and very fun for all ages while people are waiting.
